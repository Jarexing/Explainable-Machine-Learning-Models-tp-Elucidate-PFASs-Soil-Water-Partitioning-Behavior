This repository provides the code for machine learning models predicting the partitioning coefficient of PFASs and all associated raw datasets.

Four descriptor-based models  (i.e., [gradient boosting regression tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html) (GBRT), [random forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) (RF), and[ k-nearest neighbor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html) (KNN), [multiple linear regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) (MLR)) were selected to compare the predictive performance of different training methods. **Ultimately, the [RF]() model performed best** across five random splits of the dataset.

The figures folder contains the results of all the interpretive methods. Detailed information about the compounds can be found in the manuscript.

`Hyperopt` is a Python library for hyperparameter optimization using methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) and random search. It efficiently explores complex parameter spaces and scales well with large datasets, making it a popular choice for tuning machine learning models.

A `.pkl` file is a serialized file created using Python's `pickle` module, which stores objects in binary format. In the context of machine learning, a `.pkl` file typically contains a trained model, including its parameters, learned weights, and configuration, allowing it to be easily saved and reloaded without retraining.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Interpretation

We integrated a suite of interpretive analytical tools, including [permutation feature importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html) (PFI), [shapley additive explanations](https://github.com/shap/shap) (SHAP), [partial dependence plots](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html) (PDP), [individual conditional expectation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html) (ICE), and **3D interactive visualization**. These methods are crucial for uncovering the interdependencies between soil and PFAS physicochemical attributes. Furthermore, the easily accessible input features used in these models allow for the rapid estimation of Kd values for PFAS in various soils..

## üìã Collaboration and Citations

Due to the limitations of the [**training set (n=2,148)**](), certain PFAS outside its applicability domain may not have ideal predictions for partitioning behavior. We welcome contributions from other researchers to supplement data on the distribution behavior, especially for newer PFAS and less common soil types, to validate and further refine the model.
